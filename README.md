# figma-to-html

you can see live preview of this site @ -> https://jainilt.github.io/figma-to-html/

figma file link: https://www.figma.com/design/NPhBpyRMJsfS6aOwbaqm9c/HTML-Test-Practical?node-id=0-1&t=EeAH6lK9XtYynJGH-1

I have converted figma file to html 
when you open this site in your mobile device it might not load properly so kindly:
1. close the tab and open it again 
2. open that url in incognito mode


I have added javascript in which:
1. i have desktop responsive css
2. mobile responsive css

when device width is >768 then desktop.css file will run otherwise mobile.css will run.


Thank you.
